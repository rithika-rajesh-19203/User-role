 * ACCORDION — design-refs/zf-accordion.md. A disclosure list: stacked sections,
 * each with a clickable header that shows or hides its body.
 *
 * §7 — when NOT to use it: "If it must be one-at-a-time, ask whether it is
 * really tabs. An accordion that closes the previous section on every open is
 * tabs with more vertical motion." And "if there is one section, it is not an
 * accordion" — that is a single item with no container.
 *
 * ── BUILT ON <details> / <summary> ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * §8, which the Figma doc frame got to first. It gives the open state, the
 * toggle, keyboard operation and the expanded/collapsed announcement with **no
 * script and no ARIA at all**. `open` is the state, not a class — it is what the
 * browser toggles and what the accessibility tree reads.
 *
 * `group` maps to `<details name>`, so one-at-a-time is enforced by the browser
 * with no state and no effects.

 *
 * Both are correct *for their side*, so tying direction to position turns two
 * contradictions into one rule.
 *
 * Figma implements this as four real glyph swaps with `rotation: 0` everywhere —
 * correct there, because a Figma rotation carries radii and child order with it
 * (the hazard zf-input-stepper.md §10.1 records). In CSS a transform has none of
 * those hazards and animates for free, so one glyph plus a rotation is simpler.
 * The base glyph points DOWN, so `trailing` needs no transform at rest.
