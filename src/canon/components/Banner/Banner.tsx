/**
 * BANNER — one line saying what just happened, at the top of the thing it
 * happened to.
 *
 * ── EVERY TONE GETS ITS OWN SHAPE, NOT JUST ITS OWN COLOUR ──────────────────
 * `zf-design-cannon.md` §2.13.2's rule, and it is 1.4.1: a banner distinguished
 * only by being red is a banner a colour-blind user cannot tell from the green
 * one. So `danger` is a filled circle, `warning` a triangle, `success` a tick
 * and `info` an `i` — four silhouettes, readable with the colour removed.
 *
 * ── AND `alert` IS NOT A DECORATION ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `role="alert"` for `danger` and `warning`, `role="status"` otherwise. The
 * first is assertive and interrupts; the second waits its turn. A failed submit
 * has to interrupt — the user has already pressed the button and is looking
 * somewhere else — and a success note must not, because it would cut across
 * whatever they moved on to.
 *
 * The role is on a node that is **always mounted** where the caller keeps one,
 * or announced on mount where they do not. Both work; what does not work is
 * mounting the role and its text in the same tick and expecting a re-read.
