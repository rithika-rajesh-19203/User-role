/**
 * MODAL — `design-refs/zf-modal.md`, §2.27. The dialog you *do* something in.
 *
 * **All five of the md's rebuild contrast figures reproduce exactly** against
 * our primitives, and so do both of §4.4's composited hexes — the scrimmed page
 * resolves to `#8E8F93` in Light and `#0A0C11` in Dark, to the byte.
 *
 * ── IT IS NOT `zf-popup-modal`, AND §2 DRAWS THE LINE ────────────────────────
 * §2.14's modal is for **telling** — an alert, a confirmation, an announcement:
 * one padded block, 640 fixed, centred, actions centred under the content. This
 * one is for **doing** — a form, a table, a wizard step: three regions, four
 * widths, flush to the top edge, actions on the body's own margin, and the body
 * is the only thing that scrolls.
 *
 * They share `surface/default`, a 1px `border/default`, `radius/2xl` and the
 * `0 16 48 @16%` elevation, because *"two modals in one product share a corner
 * and an elevation, or the product looks assembled from parts."*
 *
 * §2.14's is not built. Nothing in this product tells rather than does yet, and
 * a component with no consumer is a component nobody has checked.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE SOURCE WAS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 17 raw nodes, no auto-layout, **not one bound paint**, all three text nodes
 * unstyled, one state of one width.
 *
 * **The close target is 8 × 8** — 64px² against the 576 a 24×24 target implies,
 * missing 89% of its area, on the only exit a pointer user has.
 *
 * **The body runs 74px underneath its own footer.** It is 324 tall from y 134
 * and the footer starts at 384. It rendered correctly only because the footer
 * painted over it — and any attempt to make the body scroll exposes that.
 *
 * **Three separate drop shadows**, on the card, the footer and the Cancel
 * button. An inner element cannot cast the container's elevation.
 *
 * **`#EBEAF2` draws all three borders** at 1.19:1 — the same hex `zf-menu.md`
 * §4.2 caught doing three other jobs.
 *
 * ── ONE FINDING WE CANNOT FIX HERE ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * §4.4: in Light the dialog is **3.23:1** against the scrimmed page and carries
 * itself. In Dark it is **1.21:1** — dimming an already-dark page moves it
 * *towards* the dialog, not away. Nothing available reaches 3:1: the border is
 * 1.52, `surface/raised` 1.29, and `border/strong` **2.88** — which is our
 * number and better than the md's 2.36, and still short.
 *
 * The fix is a token, not a component: the Dark ramp needs an overlay-tier
 * surface around `#2A2E42`. §8 decision 1.

      Chromium's close watcher grants a dialog a small number of *cancelable*
      close requests. Spend them — press Escape three times against a veto — and
      the next `cancel` arrives with `cancelable === false`, `preventDefault()`
      is a silent no-op, and the browser closes anyway. User activation between
      presses does not replenish it.

      A component that only ever calls `onRequestClose()` and returns early on a
      veto then desyncs permanently: the parent never sets `open` false, so
      `open` stays true while `el.open` is false, and the sync effect above —
      whose only dep is `open` — never fires again. The dialog can never be
      reopened.

      So: honour `cancelable`, and treat the DOM as the source of truth by also
      listening for `close`.  */

      `querySelector` alone is not enough. `input[type=hidden]` and any

      no-op, and `first ?? body` never falls through because `first` is

      dismisses the dialog when a user starts a text selection inside it and
      releases outside, which is data loss caused by a drag.
