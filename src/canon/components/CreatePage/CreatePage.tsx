/**
 * CREATE PAGE — `ZF-CREATE-PAGE.md` §2. The scrolling body and the action
 * footer of a new-record page.
 *
 * **The header is a sibling, not a child.** The md's `zf-create-page` includes
 * it, but `AppShell` already owns the page shell here and `PageHeader` already
 * owns its own 64 and its `flex-none` — nesting it would give the page two
 * components that both think they are the frame.
 *
 * **The body is the only scroller**, which is the whole reason this is a
 * component: the header stays, the footer stays, and the form moves between
 * them. A page that scrolls as a whole puts Save below the fold on every long
 * form, which is the one control the user is trying to reach.
 *
 * ── THE GRID LIVES HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `px-10` — `space/10`, 20 either side — and **no gutter**. A 12-column grid
 * usually carries one; this one does not, because the 30px input inset and the
 * one column of slack do all the separating. The consequence is worth stating:
 * a column is a *pure twelfth of the content box*, so the arithmetic is
 * `(W − 40) / 12` and nothing else. Add a gutter and every number in §2's table
 * changes, and the input stops landing on a column edge.
 *
 * `@container` is declared here too — `container-type: inline-size` on the
 * body, so `FormSection`'s reflow queries measure the FORM's width rather than
 * the viewport's. On a page behind a 220 rail that is a 220px difference, and a
 * viewport query would stack the halves at the wrong moment in both directions.

   * present from the moment the form is, and never over anything. Two different
   * things that both get called "the side panel".
   *
   * It owns its own scroller, because a fifty-file list and a long form have no
   * reason to share one.

   * by 10 and 62% of the target is unhittable, which the md measured.
   *
   * It is a mode of the page, not a tweak: §2.2 defines the column as
   * `(W − 20 − 30) / 12` when a product table is present, so the grid follows.
