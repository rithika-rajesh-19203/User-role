/**
 * SPLIT BUTTON — one default action, and a menu of its variants.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md has listed this as queued since the button family was built; the
 * product table's `Add New Row` is what finally needed it.
 *
 * ── IT IS TWO BUTTONS, AND THAT IS THE POINT ────────────────────────────────
 * Not one button with a caret. The halves do different things — the leading one
 * commits, the trailing one opens — so they are two controls, two tab stops and
 * two accessible names. A single button carrying both would have to guess from
 * the pointer's x which the user meant.
 *
 * **The trailing half needs its own name.** "Add New Row" is already spoken by
 * the half beside it, and two adjacent controls with the same accessible name is
 * a 4.1.2 defect — the same one the action bar's caret had. So it is
 * "More Add New Row actions", built from the label rather than hardcoded.
 *
 * ── THE SEAM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `join` squares off exactly the corners that touch, and `-ms-px` pulls the
 * trailing half over the leading one's border so the pair shares a single
 * hairline rather than stacking two. `hover:z-1` lets whichever half is live
 * draw its border OVER its neighbour instead of under it — without it the seam
 * flickers between two greys as the pointer crosses.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No `emphasis="primary"` default. `zf-product-table.md` §13 asks for Secondary
 * and every split button in the reference is secondary — a split PRIMARY button
 * puts two competing commitments in one control. Available, not the default.
