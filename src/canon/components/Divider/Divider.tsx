/**
 * DIVIDER — a thematic break between two blocks, or between two columns.
 *
 * An `<hr>`, not a styled `<div>`. It carries `role="separator"` for free, it is
 * what the HTML element is *for*, and — the reason it matters here — it means a
 * screen can draw a rule without a bare element, which rule 4 forbids and which
 * was previously being worked around by rendering an **empty `FormSection`** and
 * borrowing the rule it draws. A section with no rows is not a divider; it is a
 * section that failed to render.
 *
 * ── THE RULE IS THE BOX, NOT A BORDER ───────────────────────────────────────
 * `w-px` / `h-px` with a background, rather than `border-t`. Two reasons, and
 * the second is why it changed: a UA `<hr>` draws an inset 3D groove, so a
 * border approach has to zero all four edges before setting one — and border
 * widths take Tailwind's own numeric scale, so a **0.5px** border cannot be
 * expressed at all. A box can, because `--spacing-*` accepts a named key.
 *
 * ── `hairline` IS A HINT, NOT A GUARANTEE ───────────────────────────────────
 * At 1px `border/divider` is already the lightest role we have (1.20:1) and the
 * only way further down is thinner, not paler. Half a device pixel at 1x gets
 * antialiased into something fainter; at 2x it is one crisp device pixel, and
 * different engines round it differently. **Never carry information on it.**
