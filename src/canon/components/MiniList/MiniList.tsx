/**
 * MINI LIST — `design-refs/zf-mini-list.md`, §2.28. The left column of a split
 * view: a toolbar that does not scroll and a row list that does.
 *
 * **All nine of the md's contrast figures reproduce exactly** against our
 * primitives, as do both source figures and the `text/tertiary` trap.
 *
 * ── IT IS A NAVIGATION CONTROL, NOT A LIST OF LINKS ──────────────────────────
 * §5: *"a user arrowing through seven links navigates seven times."* This is a
 * `listbox` whose selection drives a route — arrows move the active option,
 * Enter opens it, and **selecting a row must not scroll the list or lose its
 * position**, because that is the entire reason the pattern exists.
 *
 * **Two selections coexist and must never be confused.** "Which record am I
 * reading" is the route; "which records am I acting on" is the checkbox. Ticking
 * a box must not navigate — hence the `stopPropagation` below, without which
 * every bulk tick also changes the page.
 *
 * ── THE ACTIVE ROW IS A FILL, AND THE FILL IS `surface/hover` ───────────────
 * §4.4 puts the selected row on `surface/selected`, which is **1.13:1** against
 * its neighbour in Light and **1.02:1** in Dark — where the selected row is
 * fractionally *darker* than the rows around it and reads as receding rather
 * than chosen. The source's own `#F8F7FC` is 1.07.
 *
 * That is why it used to carry a 2px `primary/default` leading edge. The edge
 * is gone by decision, and the fill moved to `surface/hover` — **1.08 Light,
 * 1.07 Dark** — which is a real gain in the pane that had the problem: the Dark
 * active row goes 1.02 → 1.07. Light trades 0.05 and the edge for consistency
 * with every other row treatment in the system.
 *
 * The cost is that a hovered row and the active row share a fill. The pointer
 * disambiguates, and the moment it leaves, one row stays lit. The active row's
 * own hover steps up to `surface/pressed` (1.20 / 1.16) so that pointing at it
 * is not the one place in the list that answers with nothing.
 *
 * **In `forced-colors` every fill is replaced by a system colour**, so a
 * fill-only selection is erased there whichever fill it is. `index.css` repaints
 * it as a real `border-inline-start: 2px solid Highlight` off `data-zf-selected`
 * — now the only cue that survives the mode rather than a backup for a visible
 * one.
 *
 * ── AND THE STATUS IS A BADGE, NOT COLOURED TEXT ─────────────────────────────
 * §4.4 measured the source's status at `#00B050`, 12px, **2.87:1** — a 1.4.3
 * fail on the field that says what state the record is in. Moving it to a tone
 * role only reached 4.52 on a default row and **4.01 on the selected one**, and
 * *a role that passes on one row and fails on the next is not a role you can put
 * text in.*
 *
 * So it is a `StatusBadge`, whose worst pairing across all fourteen variants is
 * **5.80** and whose best is 12.69 — and whose fill and label ship as one token
 * pair, because they are chosen together. That is also the house rule: a status
 * is a `StatusBadge`, never a coloured `Text`.
 *
 * **The word carries the meaning and the colour only reinforces it**, which is
 * what keeps it out of 1.4.1 — the source's `#00B050` carried it alone.

   * list, and putting its bar on the other side of the split makes the user
   * look away from what they are ticking to read what they have ticked.
   *
   * The three rules `PageChrome` sets out hold identically:
   *
   * **1 · One cell, one block-size.** The toolbar stays 56 whichever occupant is
   * in it, so ticking the first checkbox cannot move the list under the pointer
   * that just clicked it.
   *
   * **2 · The toolbar is hidden, never unmounted.** It owns the view switcher's
   * open menu and its scroll position; unmounting throws them away and the user
   * rebuilds them after every bulk action.
   *
   * **3 · Focus never crosses the swap.** There is no `autoFocus` here and there
   * must never be one — moving focus because a value changed is 3.2.2, and it
   * would fire on every single checkbox click.
