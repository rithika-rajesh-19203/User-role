/**
 * TABS — one record, several views of it.
 *
 * **No md on disk.** Measured off the reference and built to the ARIA Authoring
 * Practices tabs pattern, which is unusually worth following literally here:
 * tabs are the control people most often build out of buttons and `hidden`, and
 * the result announces as a row of buttons next to some text with no stated
 * relationship between them.
 *
 * ── THE FOUR THINGS THAT MAKE IT A TAB AND NOT A BUTTON ─────────────────────
 * **1 · One tab stop for the strip.** `role="tablist"` with a roving
 * `tabIndex` — Tab moves *past* the tabs to the panel, arrows move *between*
 * them. Three tabs that are three tab stops is three presses to reach the
 * content, and the content is what the user came for. 2.1.1.
 *
 * **2 · The panel is `aria-labelledby` its tab and the tab is `aria-controls`
 * its panel.** That pairing is the entire semantic content of the pattern. A
 * screen-reader user who lands in the panel is told which tab they are in.
 *
 * **3 · Selection follows focus, and the panel is `tabIndex={0}`.** Arrowing
 * onto a tab activates it — the APG's default for a cheap panel — and the panel
 * itself takes focus next, so Tab out of the strip lands *in* the content
 * rather than skipping it.
 *
 * **4 · The indicator is 2px, not 1.** A 1px underline sits directly on the
 * strip's own 1px bottom rule and the two read as one slightly darker hairline;
 * at 2 the selected tab is unambiguous. It is also drawn on `primary/default`
 * (4.32:1) with the label on `primary/text` (5.92) — the indicator is a
 * graphic and clears 1.4.11's 3:1; the label is text and clears 1.4.3's 4.5.
 * Using one role for both would fail one of the two.
 *
 * ── AND THE THING IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ───────────────────────────────
 * No `orientation="vertical"`, and no scrolling strip. A vertical tab list is a
 * different component with a different keyboard model (Up/Down, not Left/Right)
 * — §1's test: *if two values need different HTML, they are different
 * components*, and this one would need different behaviour as well.

          A `border-b` on the padded element spans its padding box and runs edge
          to edge — which reads as the card being divided in two, rather than as
          the tabs having a baseline. Inset, it starts under the first tab and

          be `--zf-chrome-section-pad` because 30 was retired; it is declared as
          `space/15` since ZF-CREATE-PAGE.md §3.1, so the token is gone and the
          form grid and this strip share one owner for the number.
