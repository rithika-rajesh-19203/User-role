/**
 * BUTTON — design-refs/zf-button.md. 208 Figma variants across four sets.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS ONE COMPONENT AND NOT FOUR ───────────────────────────────────
 * The sharpest test in CLAUDE.md is: if two values need different HTML, they are
 * different components. Applied to the four sets:
 *
 *   Button        <button>                       ─┐ same element, so one
 *   Button Icons  <button> with no text child     ─┘ component
 *   Hyperlink     <a>                              different element
 *   Split Button  two interactive regions          different element
 *
 * So `Button Icons` is not a component. It is this component with no children —
 * which also dissolves md defect 4, where the Figma set declares a `Label` TEXT
 * property and contains zero text nodes to put it in. Here the label is the
 * children, and its absence is what makes the button icon-only. 96 + 96 Figma
 * variants collapse into one API.
 *
 * `Hyperlink` and `Split Button` are separate components, still queued.
 *
 * ── AND WHY STATE IS NOT A PROP ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Figma's fourth axis is `State` = Default / Hover / Focus / Disabled. A button
 * is a `<button>`, so all four are native pseudo-classes and inventing props for
 * them would mean the component could render "hover" while the pointer is
 * elsewhere. md §11 reaches the same conclusion. That removes a factor of four.
 *
 * 4 intents x 2 emphases x 3 sizes = 24 real variants.

/**
 * The side padding, SPLIT OUT of the size — because `tertiary` takes none.
 *
 * A text button has no fill and no border, so it has no box to pad: its padding
 * would only push the label off whatever edge it is meant to line up with. It
 * has to be a separate map rather than a `px-0` appended to the size string,
 * because two `px-*` utilities on one element are the same specificity and the
 * winner is decided by the order Tailwind emitted them — the hazard this file

 * reuses hover and a press produces no visible change. Only `primary` and

/**
 * SECONDARY — the intent rides the LABEL, not the fill and not the border.
 *
 * md §5.4 measures Secondary's border at 1.31:1 and records that no `border/*`
 * role in the system reaches the 3:1 of WCAG 1.4.11. We measured the intent
 * borders too, and they are no better: `success/border` 1.42, `warning/border`
 * 1.69, `danger/border` 1.75. So an intent-coloured border would fail exactly as
 * hard while looking like it had solved something.
 *
 * The `{family}/text` roles, by contrast, clear it comfortably on the button's
 * own fill — 5.92 / 8.06 / 7.77 / 7.04 in Light and higher in Dark. So the label
 * carries the intent, legibly, and the border stays neutral.
 *
 * This is an extension beyond the md, which states no per-intent Secondary values
 * at all — its own CSS has one `.zf-btn--secondary` rule. Without it `intent`
 * would be a prop that does nothing on half the matrix, which is CLAUDE.md's
 * fourth test for a fake axis: one value making another axis irrelevant. It is
 * also the correct use of these roles, which is the point of md §4: bind to the
 * role that MEANS the right thing.
 *
 * ── TWO VALUES HERE DIVERGE FROM §5.3, AND NO ROLE CAN CLOSE THEM ────────────
 * §5.3 measures the Secondary rest fill as `neutral/100` #FAFAFC and the hover
 * fill as `neutral/200` #F7F8FC. **No semantic role holds either step** —
 * `surface/default` and `surface/raised` are both `base/white`, and
 * `surface/hover` is `neutral/300`. So this renders white on rest (15.15:1
 * against §5.3's 14.54) and `neutral/300` on hover (14.05 against 14.28).
 *
 * Left as roles rather than closed with two new tokens, because §5.4 says the
 * fill is doing no work anyway: "#FAFAFC against a white page is 1.04:1, so the
 * fill contributes nothing, and the border is doing all the work of saying this
 * is a control." White makes that literal. If design wants the hair of
 * separation back it needs a role, not a component change.

 * family on this intent too, and it is `secondary` that is the outlier, because
 * an outlined button's label is text sitting on white. Quiet means no box, not a
 * different meaning.
 *
 * It UNDERLINES on hover and focus, which is zf-button.md defect 3's own
 * recommended fix — the md records `Hyperlink` as having no underline in any
 * state, "a link identified by colour alone, so 1.4.1 is unmet". A tertiary
