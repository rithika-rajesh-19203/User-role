/**
 * ACTION BAR — `design-refs/zf-action-bar.md`, §2.26. What replaces the page
 * header while rows are selected.
 *
 * **All six of the md's rebuild contrast figures reproduce exactly** against our
 * primitives, as do its three ΔE values and the 1.45:1 button stroke.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE SOURCE WAS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A 37-node group of raw rectangles — no auto-layout, no variant, **no bound
 * paint**, no text style, and no expression at all of the thing that makes an
 * action bar an action bar: the moment it replaces the page header.
 *
 * **The count "06" is 4.39:1 on its chip** — a 1.4.3 failure at 12px, on the one
 * number the whole component exists to report. Here `primary/text` on
 * `primary/subtle` is **5.25 / 7.56**.
 *
 * **"Selected" is pure `#000000`** — 19.32 ΔE from `text/default`, a value that
 * appears nowhere else in 26 components. It is not a token; it is what happens
 * when a colour picker opens at its default.
 *
 * **The close glyph is `#FE4242`** — a destructive red 30.75 ΔE from
 * `danger/default`, on a control that destroys nothing. Red on a safe control
 * teaches distrust of red everywhere.
 *
 * **Three stacked shadows**, the first with `spread: 1` at zero offset and zero
 * blur — a 1px hard-edged 4%-black outline, a border wearing a shadow's clothes.
 * One `shadow/popover` here, which is the same `0 8 24 #12141F @12%` five
 * components now carry by hand (§11 decision 1).
 *
 * **Nothing is where it says it is.** Two controls at two different `y` — 63 and
 * 64.57, and *neither* centres in a 48px bar, whose centre is 65.
 *
 * ── ONE FINDING THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO US ────────────────────────────────────
 * §4.4 reports that building this bar exposed **every Secondary button in the
 * system rendering 1.04:1 in Dark** — 217 fills bound to the single-mode
 * `ZF Primitives` while their labels flipped. Our `Button` has been on semantic
 * roles since it was built, and its rest fill is already `surface/default` and
 * not `surface/raised` — which §4.4 calls load-bearing, because `raised` and
 * `hover` are the same primitive in Dark and a Secondary button on `raised`
 * would have a dead hover. Nothing to fix; worth recording that it was checked.

      focus — leaves focus on `<body>`: the next Tab restarts at the top of the
      document, and nothing on screen says where you are.

               owner has overruled it, so this is `danger/default`: **6.09:1

               hex, which was 30.75 ΔE from anything the palette owns.

               The reasoning survives even though the decision did not — if a
