/**
 * MENU — `design-refs/zf-menu.md`, §2.25. A floating list of commands with
 * sub-menus, and a keyboard model.
 *
 * **We re-derived 20 of the md's figures against our own primitives and all 20
 * reproduce exactly** — every contrast pair in §4.3, both of §3.2/§4.5's traps,
 * and all three source numbers (3.27, 3.02, 1.19). It is the first md in this
 * series to score perfect against our token layer.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE SOURCE WAS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 22 hand-drawn nodes — two rounded `VECTOR`s, four `LINE`s, ten `FRAME`s — with
 * **not one bound paint**, no component, no instance, no text style and no state
 * beyond the two that happened to be drawn. Four things do not survive:
 *
 * **The submenu's active row is white on `#408DFB` — 3.27:1.** A 1.4.3 failure at
 * 13px on the one row the design is drawing attention to. It clears 1.4.11 at
 * 3.0, which is why it looks fine in a screenshot. §9 does not fill the active
 * row at all: `surface/hover` with `text/default` is **14.05:1**, and a menu's
 * active row is a hover-and-focus state, not a selection.
 *
 * **`#EBEAF2` is the panel border, all four separators AND the open row's
 * highlight** — one hex carrying a boundary, a divider and a state, at 1.19:1
 * against the panel, so it carries none of them. Three roles here.
 *
 * **The drop shadow is `#D7D5E2` at 100% alpha.** Not a shadow — an opaque grey
 * band offset 3px down, **3.94 ΔE from `border/default`**: the colour someone
 * would pick if they were drawing a border on purpose.
 *
 * **The submenu indicator is a DOWN caret on a flyout that opens SIDEWAYS**, and
 * the three rows that carry one pad 10 on the right while the three with nothing
 * pad 30 — exactly inverted.
 *
 * ── TWO ROLES THAT LOOK RIGHT AND ARE NOT ────────────────────────────────────
 * **`surface/raised` is `neutral/1900` in Dark — the same primitive as
 * `surface/hover`.** A menu built on the role whose name says "floating panel"
 * has **no hover state at all in Dark**: 1.00:1. Verified. `surface/default`
 * here, on which hover is 1.08 / 1.07 — weak, but real. §11 decision 1.
 *
 * **`danger/subtle` is 1.00:1 against the panel in Dark** (`red/2000` against
 * `neutral/2000`). So `tone: 'danger'` recolours the label and the glyph only —
 * `danger/text` at 7.04 / 9.27 — and takes the same hover and pressed fills as
 * every other row. The md's own build shipped nine variants on `danger/subtle`
 * before catching it.
 *
 * ── WHERE THIS DIVERGES FROM §9 ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * §9.3 packages the trigger and the panel as one `MoreMenu`. This takes an
 * `anchor` instead, which is **§11 decision 7 answered**: *"a menu opened from a
 * `zf-button`, a table row's ⋯, or a right-click needs the same panel and a
 * different anchor; none of that is specified."* An anchor-based menu needs no
 * `.zf-menu-trigger` rule, and `PageHeader`'s own action already is one.

 * mutating it later does not schedule one — so the value the component sees can
 * be stale with nothing to correct it. 14 of 15 call sites did this, six of them
 * in screens, and `react-hooks/refs` flags every one.
 *
 * It appeared to work only by luck: this menu reads the anchor exclusively from
 * effects gated on `open`, and `open` cannot become true without a state change
 * that re-renders and re-reads the ref. Change any one of those things — read
 * the anchor during render, or open the menu from something other than state —
 * and it anchors to `null`.
 *
 * Passing the ref itself removes the hazard rather than papering over it: the
 * component resolves `.current` at the moment it needs it, inside the effect,
 * where it is guaranteed populated.

      A rectangular corridor between the two panels provably cannot work: the
      straight line from a parent row's centre to the flyout's third row crosses
      TWO SIBLING ROWS inside the panel, and each arms its own 150ms timer that
      closes the flyout. The md measured it — hovering "Sort by" then
      "Preferences" closed it every time, with a 12px corridor in place.

      The triangle runs from the pointer's last position to the flyout's near
      edge. Inside it, another row's timer is 300ms instead of 150, which is long
      enough to arrive. That 300 is a chosen value, not a measured one — the md
      says so in its Provenance.  */
