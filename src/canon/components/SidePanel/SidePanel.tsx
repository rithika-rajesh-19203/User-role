/**
 * SIDE PANEL — design-refs/zf-side-panel.md. A right-hand drawer: a titled
 * header, a scrollable body, an optional action footer.
 *
 * §7 — when NOT to use it: "If the user must answer before continuing, it is a
 * modal, not a panel. A panel that blocks is a modal with the wrong geometry."
 * And "if it never closes, it is not a panel" — a permanent right-hand rail is
 * layout, and needs no scrim, no close button and no dialog semantics.
 *
 * ── THE HEADLINE DEFECT, FIXED ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * §2: **the Figma component is a modal panel with no scrim.** The
 * `overlay/scrim` role was created for it and *nothing in the entire file uses
 * it* — the only matches for "overlay", "scrim" or "backdrop" anywhere are text
 * nodes inside two documentation frames.
 *
 * That is not a missing rectangle. The scrim is what makes the panel modal, it
 * is the click-outside target, it is what dims the page so the panel reads as
 * *above* rather than *beside*, and it is what `aria-modal` implies visually.
 * "A panel without one is a `<div>` pinned to the right of the page, not a
 * dialog."
 *
 * ── <dialog> DOES THE WORK ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * §8. `showModal()` gives, with no script: the top layer (so nothing can
 * z-index above it), `::backdrop` for the scrim, a focus trap, Esc-to-close,
 * `inert` on everything behind, and focus return to the opener. Those are
 * precisely the things §6 lists as code-only — "and they are the four things
 * hand-rolled drawers get wrong".
